Purpose:
This program is run using the command 'python menuBasics.py'. It makes use of a naive menu method to discern which option to test. It will prompt the user asking them to choose if
they want to test the Turing Test (1), Temperature Converter (2), or calculate the hyptoneuse of a triangle (3). These three methods are not connected in any way. They are primarily
just placeholders methods that allowed me to test the menu system.
